## Onboarding-digital


Â¡Welcome to the Onboarding-digital! This is my first React project, focuses on building a digital Onboarding experience using React, leveraging fundamental concepts such as components, hooks, and props. The application guides users through a series of steps, each represented by a card containing descriptive text and an accompanying image.


## Features
